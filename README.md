📌 *Problem Statement*

Predicting the stock market has always been a challenging yet fascinating task for data scientists. The motivation is not only potential profit but the intellectual challenge of uncovering hidden patterns in market behavior.

Like many others, I explored the use of **additive models and machine learning techniques** to predict stock movements using simulated funds. While beating the market daily is nearly impossible, the process taught me:

* Python programming & OOP
* Data manipulation techniques
* Machine learning modeling
* Data visualization
* Why long-term investment is wiser than daily trading

This project is built on four major analytical foundations:

🔍 1. Fundamental Analysis

Evaluating a company’s financial health, stability, and intrinsic value.

 📊 2. Technical Analysis

Identifying market patterns using historical price data, trends, and indicators.

💬 3. Sentiment Analysis

Observing public sentiment using social media and news to anticipate market moves.

🤖 4. Machine Learning Approaches

Training ML models to learn from historical data to predict future stock prices.

📝 Abstract

Stock market prediction plays a crucial role in financial decision-making. Daily price fluctuations influence personal investments, savings, and long-term wealth. Being able to anticipate future movements helps investors:

* Choose profitable stocks
* Avoid high-risk investments
* Understand company performance
* Make informed financial decisions

Since the stock market is highly volatile and influenced by macroeconomic, sector-specific, and political factors, prediction becomes a difficult task.

In this project, we use **machine learning** to forecast stock prices using historical data (2010–2019). A deep learning model is trained to predict future movements and compared with actual results. Our model outperforms several conventional ML approaches, demonstrating the strength of neural networks in time-series forecasting.

🧪 **Proposed Solution**

* Historical stock data from **2010–2019** was collected.

* The dataset was split into:

  * **70% Training Data**
  * **30% Testing Data**

* The model was trained on the training set and predictions were generated on the testing set.

* Multiple visualizations were created to show:

  * Actual vs. predicted prices
  * Moving averages (100-day & 200-day MA)
  * Stock trends over time

This approach provides a clear understanding of how the model performs in predicting real-world stock prices.

🧠 *Result Analysis*

* The prediction model closely follows actual market trends.
* Moving averages (100-day & 200-day) smoothen volatility and help identify long-term trends.
* Although short-term fluctuations remain unpredictable, the model performs well in forecasting overall movement.

This demonstrates that machine learning can be a useful tool for **long-term trend analysis**, but not for daily trading.



 **Conclusion**

There is no single best machine learning algorithm for stock prediction. Performance varies depending on:

* Type of stock
* Market behavior
* Data quality
* Economic conditions

Common ML models used include:
Support Vector Machines
Decision Trees
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

However, stock prediction remains a complex challenge because many factors like economic stability, company performance, political changes, and global events influence market behavior.
Therefore, analysts combine **fundamental analysis**, **technical analysis**, and **machine learning** to improve prediction accuracy. Even then, predictions are never perfect — which is why **long-term investing** remains the safest and most reliable strategy.
